%description
The Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) is a free open-source software
system for development of interactive medical image processing software.
MITK combines the Insight Toolkit (ITK) and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)
with an application framework for medical imaging.

This package provides the core MITK libraries without the Workbench application
(BlueBerry/CTK require Qt6 CTK which is not yet available in Fedora).

%package devel
Summary:        Development files for MITK
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:       InsightToolkit5-devel
Requires:       vtk-devel
Requires:       boost-devel
Requires:       dcmtk-devel

%description devel
Development files, headers, and CMake config for building applications
and plugins that use the MITK libraries.

# Fix ITK PhilipsREC IO factory: MITK defines ITK_IO_FACTORY_REGISTER_MANAGER

# registration symbol is unresolved. Add it to the IO modules list.

%changelog
* Thu Mar 19 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan.hough@gmail.com> - 2025.12.2-3
- Remove incorrect eigen3-devel Requires from -devel subpackage
  (MITK gets Eigen through ITK5 which bundles it)

* Thu Mar 19 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan.hough@gmail.com> - 2025.12.2-2
- Fix ITK PhilipsREC IO factory linkage (add IOPhilipsREC to MitkCore deps)

* Mon Mar 03 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan.hough@gmail.com> - 2025.12.2-1
- Major rewrite: disable superbuild, use system libraries
- Use InsightToolkit5 5.4.5 and VTK 9.5.2 from COPR
- Disable BlueBerry/CTK (Fedora CTK is Qt5-only)
- Phase 1: core libraries only, no MitkWorkbench
- GCC 15 / Fedora 43 compatibility fixes
