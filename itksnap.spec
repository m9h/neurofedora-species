%description
ITK-SNAP is a software application used to segment structures in 3D and 4D
biomedical images such as MRI, CT, and PET scans.  It provides:

  * Semi-automatic segmentation using active contour methods
  * AI-assisted segmentation (nnInteractive: point, scribble, lasso modes)
  * Manual delineation and label editing tools
  * High-performance OpenGL2-based 2D slice rendering
  * External 3D/4D mesh visualization

This package also includes the Convert3D (c3d) command-line image conversion
tool and the Greedy diffeomorphic image registration tool, both of which are
built as subprojects alongside ITK-SNAP.

%changelog
* Wed May 20 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.6
- Rebuild against InsightToolkit5 5.4.6 (the -0.5 RPM was built against
  5.4.5 on 2026-05-02 and segfaults at startup against a system with
  ITK 5.4.6 installed: libjsoncpp.so.26's static initializer crashes
  during dl_init for the ITK-SNAP binary, presumably due to ABI drift
  in a VTK/ITK transitive that pulled in jsoncpp differently between
  the build chroot then and the user system now).
- Bump InsightToolkit5-devel BR to >= 5.4.6.

* Mon May 04 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0-1
- Update to stable 4.4.0 release (September 9, 2025)

* Sun Mar 01 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.5
- Remove qt.conf from /usr/bin (Qt deploy artifact, not needed for system install)

* Sun Mar 01 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.4
- Fix file list: add itksnap-wt, greedy_template_average, multi_chunk_greedy,
  greedy_propagation; add forwarding binary at /usr/lib/snap-*/ITK-SNAP and
  qt.conf; remove nonexistent /usr/share/itksnap directory

* Fri Feb 27 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.3
- Add VTK transitive BuildRequires: json-devel, freetype-devel, jsoncpp-devel,
  utf8cpp-devel, PEGTL-devel, lz4-devel, double-conversion-devel; VTK cmake
  config propagates these as required link targets into downstream builds

* Fri Feb 27 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.2
- Patch CMakeLists.txt in prep: replace get_git_commit_date() with set() to
  avoid CMake error when building from a tarball with no git history

* Wed Feb 25 2026 Morgan Hough <morgan@hough.dev> - 4.4.0~beta2-0.1
- Initial spec for ITK-SNAP 4.4.0-beta2
- Bundles c3d and greedy as CMake subprojects per upstream design
- Requires VTK >= 9.3.1 and ITK 5.4 from mhough/neurofedora COPR
